# Installation

Follow these steps to easily install **KRX Client**:

## Recommended System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (Linux works with Wine but isn't officially supported).
- **CPU**: Minimum 4 cores (x64 architecture preferred over x86).
- **RAM**: At least 8 GB for smooth performance.

## Installation Steps
1. Download the KRX Client zipped folder from [krxclient.xyz](https://krxclient.xyz).
2. Extract the folder using your preferred unzipping tool.
3. Open the extracted folder and launch **KRX Client.exe**.
4. If you are using the **Premium** or **Ultimate** version, log in with your credentials. 
**Note:** Use your username, not your email. For example, if your email is `johndoe@example.com`, and your username is `johndoe123`, you would use `johndoe123`.

## Troubleshooting
- **Executable Missing**: If the `KRX Client` executable isn't visible, your antivirus software may have removed it. Disable real-time protection temporarily and extract the folder again.
- **Other Issues**: For additional help, check the [FAQ section](../faq.md) or contact our support team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MwzsHadQAe).
