4. **[Fentbot](goresbot/fentbot.md)** ![Ultimate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate-%23f76d6d?style=flat-square)

## **Basic Gores Bot**
The basic Gores Bot included with the free and premium version has no configurable settings and only uses directional keys for movement.  
Overall, it’s a simple bot meant for basic use.

## **Legit Gores Bot** ![Ultimate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate-%23f76d6d?style=flat-square)
The Legit Bot is best for players who want to look legit while avoiding freeze. It avoids freezing with minimal changes to your inputs and allows for some configuration.  
This bot can fail and partially depends on the skill of the user, which is part of what makes it "legit." However, it may cause a drop in FPS on some systems.  

For more details, see [Legit Gores Bot](goresbot/legit.md).

## **Blatant Gores Bot** ![Ultimate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate-%23f76d6d?style=flat-square)
The Blatant Gores Bot is perfect for anyone who doesn’t want to fail and wants to easily complete even the hardest Gores maps. It’s very easy to configure.  
One of the advantages of the Blatant Bot is that it keeps your tee safe above everything else. You can configure settings like aiming, limiting inputs, and how much the bot predicts based on your preferences.  

For more details, see [Blatant Gores Bot](goresbot/blatant.md).

## **Fentbot** ![Ultimate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ultimate-%23f76d6d?style=flat-square)
The Fentbot (fentanyl-themed bot) is best for advanced users. It’s a kind of auto-TAS bot that finds inputs using pathfinding to complete maps.  
This bot focuses solely on following its path, so it might fail or perform sub-optimal moves at times. It is highly configurable and runs asynchronously, so while you play the map this bot finds inputs to complete it. It’s best used on KoG maps.  

For more details, see [Fentbot](goresbot/fentbot.md).
