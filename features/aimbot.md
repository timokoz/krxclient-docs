# Aimbot

The **Aimbot** tab in KRX Client is designed to give you a competitive edge in Teeworlds by offering precise targeting and extensive customization options.   
Starting from the **Premium** tier, the Aimbot provides functionality for all weapons, edge hook mechanics, and advanced settings, such as grenade move prediction, edge accuracy, and adjustable shooting delays.

## **Features**

- **Enable**: Toggles the Aimbot on or off.
- **Draw FOV**: Displays the Field of View (FOV) circle, showing the Aimbot's range.
- **FOV Slider**: Adjusts the FOV radius to fine-tune targeting accuracy.`.
- **Target Priority**: Determines the method for selecting targets:
  - **Closest to Crosshair**: Targets based on the distance from your crosshair. This option ensures more precise identification but may struggle with hammer aimbot in some scenarios.
  - **Closest to Player**: Targets the nearest player to you. Ideal for HvH scenarios or more aggressive playstyles.
- **Silent**: Makes Aimbot adjustments invisible on your screen while remaining visible to others.
- **Ignore Friends**: Prevents the Aimbot from targeting friends or teammates.
- **Target Box**: Highlights targets with boxes (red for hook, orange for weapon). Useful for PvP modes but may be distracting in casual play.
- **Target Glow**: Adds a glow effect to targets. Note: This does not work with tees that have a solid black color.
- **Advanced Settings**: Unlocks additional control over Aimbot behavior. ![Premium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Premium-%23ffba00?style=flat-square)
- **Grenade Move Prediction**: Anticipates target movements to improve grenade accuracy. **Note:** This is CPU-intensive and not recommended for low-end PCs. ![Premium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Premium-%23ffba00?style=flat-square)
- **Edge Accuracy**: Adjusts edge hook precision: ![Premium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Premium-%23ffba00?style=flat-square)
