# TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun)

The **TAS** tab in the KRX Client Ultimate version is a beta feature designed for advanced tool-assisted gameplay, enabling precise and repeatable inputs.  
For the smoothest TAS experience, we recommend using the `/showall` command upon joining a server.  
*Note: This feature is currently under rework, and its functionality may change in the future.*

## **TAS**
- **Enable**: Activates TAS and teleports you to the TAS world.

- **Player Prediction**: Adds other players to the TAS world.

## **FAQ**
1. **Q: Why don’t I see weapons in TAS?**  
   **A:** You didn’t run the command `/showall`.  

2. **Q: Why can’t I continue my run after a map change?**  
   **A:** Unfortunately, continuing is not supported across map changes. Stop recording, join the map on a different server, and continue from there.  

3. **Q: What are these warnings like `Verify TAS Integrity failed...`?**  
   **A:** These warnings ensure smooth TAS runs. You can usually ignore them, but they help with debugging issues—please share them with us if you encounter problems.  

4. **Q: Why did my TAS fail mid-run?**  
   **A:** TAS failures usually occur due to lag. Use the appropriate `cl_prediction_margin` setting and restart the replay from the correct starting position. Contact support if the issue persists.  

5. **Q: Why can’t I move in TAS?**  
   **A:** Most likely, TAS is paused or `krx_tasrespawn` is set to 1. Unpause TAS or run `krx_tasrespawn 0` in the console to fix this.  

6. **Q: Why don’t I see anything when entering TAS?**  
   **A:** You need to respawn. Use the Respawn hotkey to resolve this.  

7. **Q: Why can’t I rewind or forward?**  
   **A:** You need to start recording in TAS to use rewind or forward. If step rewind/forward is enabled, the changes may be too subtle to notice—disable it if needed.
